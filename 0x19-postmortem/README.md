Issue Summary:

On March 5th, 2023, our cloud storage service experienced a two-hour outage from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM PST, during which users were unable to access their files. The outage impacted 75% of our users and resulted in significant disruptions to their daily workflows.

Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of our storage servers, specifically a faulty disk that led to data corruption and prevented access to the affected files.

Timeline:

12:00 PM PST: Our monitoring system detected a high rate of errors on the affected server, signaling an outage.

12:05 PM PST: We dispatched an engineer to investigate the issue and determine the cause.

12:15 PM PST: The engineer identified the affected server and attempted to restore access to the files.

12:30 PM PST: The engineer confirmed that a faulty disk needed to be replaced and escalated the issue to our infrastructure team for coordination.

1:00 PM PST: Our infrastructure team began replacing the faulty disk.

2:00 PM PST: The faulty disk was replaced, and the affected files were restored. The service was fully operational again.

Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Our engineer initially suspected network connectivity problems due to some users reporting slow upload and download speeds, which resulted in some time being spent on network troubleshooting before the root cause was correctly identified as a hardware failure.

Actions Taken:

Once we confirmed the hardware failure, our infrastructure team quickly coordinated the replacement of the faulty disk. We provided frequent updates to our users through our social media channels and email communications to keep them informed throughout the outage.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a faulty disk in one of our storage servers. We replaced the disk and restored the affected files. Moving forward, we will implement additional monitoring to detect and prevent similar hardware failures.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent future incidents, we will take the following corrective and preventative measures:

*Increase disk health monitoring and implement alerts for potential disk failures.
*Improve our disaster recovery plan to minimize the impact of hardware failures.
*Increase infrastructure redundancy to reduce the likelihood of widespread outages.
*Conduct regular reviews of our systems and processes to identify areas for improvement.
*Develop a communication plan to promptly notify users of outages and provide status updates.
Conclusion:

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this outage and are committed to delivering a reliable and high-quality service to our users. We have taken steps to address the root cause of the issue and will continue to improve our systems and processes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
